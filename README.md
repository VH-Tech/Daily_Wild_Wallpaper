# Daily_Wild_Wallpaper

This program fetches images from instagram handle of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India which are shared with the hashtag "#morningfromthewild" and stores them all in a folder specified by the user. Which can be then used as a source of a slideshow wallpaper.

It's an amazing source of pictures from the wild and comes out really good as a wallpaper!
I personally have been enjoying these amazing wallpapers and want to share it with everyone!

Here are some of the sample pictures :
